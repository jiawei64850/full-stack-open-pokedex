In typescript, Enlist, Tsc, and Jest are powerful tools during the stage of CI setup. Enlist, which is an effective linting tools for JavaScript and typescript, allows user to check the quality of block of code and create their own rule for to discover problems, sometimes, fix them automatically. Second, Tsc is an official complier and builder for typescript with command-line interface, transforming typescript’s code into JavaScript one and let the environment understand it. Finally, Jest, which is a testing framework created by Facebook, could help programmers to start test quickly. This tool is well-documented, abundant API supported, and little configuration required. 

Expect for Jenkins and GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline and Azure Pipelines, the former one could combine with AWS Services, custom plugin and access control. The latter one could integrate with Github, Windows and Azure platform, and owned its container support.

In general, most small or medium projects would choose cloud-based solutions, due to easy configuration and cheap cost. My project is an individual one, absolutely, would follow this choice. I don’t need to take care of my configuration. It could save my time and energy, let me devote it to the core coding stage for better outcome for my work.
